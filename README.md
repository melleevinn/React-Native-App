# React-Native-App

1. Project Overview
This React Native application is a multi-screen mobile app that allows users to browse through a digital menu, add items to a shopping cart, select courses (like Starters, Mains, Desserts), and calculate the total cart price. The app is designed to offer a modern and user-friendly experience, suitable for private chefs or restaurant owners looking to digitize their menus.

2. App Features
Home Screen: Displays the available dishes, with options to filter by course and add items to the cart.
Add Menu Item Screen: Allows the user to add new dishes to the menu dynamically. Users provide the name, price, and course of the dish.
Course Selection Screen: Enables filtering menu items by course type (Starters, Mains, or Desserts).
Cart Screen: Displays the selected items and calculates the total price of the items in the cart.

3. Technology Stack
React Native: The core framework used to build the mobile app.
JavaScript: Used to write the app logic.
React Navigation: For navigating between screens.
StyleSheet: Used for the modern design and layout.

4. How It Works
The app uses React Navigation to handle transitions between the different screens. State management is done using Reactâ€™s useState hooks for managing menu items, cart items, and totals.
